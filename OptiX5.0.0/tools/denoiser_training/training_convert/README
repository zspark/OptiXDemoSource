sources to convert png files to numpy format

mmrgb converts beauty and bsdf .exr files into .npy files
script must be called with a directory containing the .exr files, and the directory where the
converted .npy files should be stored

mmnormal converts normal vector exr files

train_setup.c must be compiled, it creates a training directory from input RGB beauty files.
files must have a certain filename (see training_run.py) so that this tool can group scenes
and select the image with the higher sample count in each scene as the reference image.
